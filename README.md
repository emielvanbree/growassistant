Of course! Here is the revised user manual, specifically tailored for growing autoflower cannabis and highlighting the integrated Royal Queen Seeds (RQS) webshop features.

Welcome to Kweekmaatje (Grow Buddy)! Your Autoflower Grow Coach üå±
Welcome to your personal assistant for growing autoflower cannabis. Autoflowers are special; they grow fast and flower automatically, which means timing is everything. This app takes the guesswork out of the process, giving you a clear schedule, timely reminders, and a place to keep a photo diary of your plant's rapid journey from seed to harvest.

This manual will walk you through everything you need to know.

The Main Screen: Your Control Center
When you first open the app, the screen is simple. At the very top, you'll find your main controls.

Language Selector: Switch the app's language (English, Dutch, German, etc.).

Dark Mode: Easier on the eyes, especially for late-night checks in the grow tent.

Your First Autoflower: The Journey Begins
Ready to plant that seed?

Click the big + New Plant button.

A new "plant card" will instantly appear. This is the dedicated dashboard for one plant.

Setting Up Your Plant Card
The new card has a few things you should set up right away:

Plant Name: Click the default name (like "Plant 1") to type in your own, like "Fat Banana Auto."

Strain: Use the dropdown menu to select the specific autoflower strain you are growing. The app has built-in schedules for popular strains, many from Royal Queen Seeds (RQS). If your strain isn't listed, "Unknown/Generic" is a great starting point.

Planted Date: Select the day your seed first sprouted. This is your plant's "birthday" and is crucial for the automated schedule.

Buy Seeds with the 'Buy now' button: Notice the Buy now button next to the strain selector. If you haven't bought your seeds yet, this is a handy link that takes you directly to the Royal Queen Seeds (RQS) webshop to purchase that exact strain!

Once set, the plant's Age is calculated for you in weeks and days.

Managing Your Plant: The Three Tabs
Inside each plant card are three tabs to organize everything: Timeline, Reminders, and Notes.

üì∏ Timeline Tab
This is your plant's photo album. It‚Äôs the best way to see how quickly autoflowers shoot up!

To Add a Photo:

Select the Date the photo was taken.

Optionally, add a short Note (e.g., "First pistils showing!").

Click "Choose File" to select a picture from your device.

Click Upload Photo.

Your photos will be organized by week, creating a satisfying visual log of your grow.

‚öôÔ∏è Reminders Tab
This is the brain of the operation. Here, you can fine-tune the automated schedule for watering, feeding, and other key events to match your specific setup.

Customize Your Schedule: Adjust how often to water, which week to start feeding, and when to flush and harvest. The app's defaults are a great starting point based on your chosen strain.

Get Tips: Click the little ? buttons for helpful tips about what your autoflower needs during its current phase.

Buy Nutrients with the 'Buy now' button: You'll also find a Buy now button in this tab. Depending on your plant's phase, this button conveniently links you to the recommended growth or bloom nutrients on the RQS webshop. This makes it easy to get the right food for your plant at the right time.

üìù Notes Tab
This is a simple digital notepad for each plant. It's the perfect place to track details like:

The pH or EC/PPM of your nutrient solution.

Notes on training techniques like Low-Stress Training (LST).

Observations on trichome development or any pest issues.

The Grow Cycle in Action
As your autoflower grows, its card will become your daily go-to.

The Progress Bar
This visual timeline is the heart of your plant card. It shows you exactly where your plant is in its lifecycle.

Autoflower Phases: The bar is color-coded to show the typical autoflower growth stages: Seedling, the short Vegetative period, the automatic Flowering stage, and the final Flush.

Today Marker: A red line shows your current position in the timeline, so you always know what's next.

Action Reminders
Your personal grow coach will pop up with reminders for crucial tasks right above the progress bar.

üíß Water: Time to hydrate your plant!

ü•¶ Feed: Your autoflower is hungry for nutrients.

üí¶ START FLUSH: Stop feeding and give only pH'd water to improve the final taste.

ü™¥ HARVEST: The moment you've been waiting for!

When you complete a task, just click on the reminder. This checks it off your list and keeps your dashboard clean.

Finishing a Cycle & Sharing Your Success
Archiving Your Plant
Once you've harvested your autoflower, you can archive the card. This moves it to a separate "Archived" section, hiding it from your main dashboard but keeping the photos and notes safe. You can look back at your grow diary anytime by checking the Show Archived box in the header.

Sharing a Report
Want to show off your frosty buds? Click the Share icon in the header. The app will create a cool summary image of your active plants, including their latest photo. It's perfect for sharing with friends or on grow forums.

A Note on Privacy
One of the best things about Kweekmaatje is that your privacy is 100% guaranteed. All the data you enter‚Äîplant names, notes, and photos‚Äîis saved only on your own device in your browser's local storage. Nothing is ever sent to a server or seen by anyone else.
