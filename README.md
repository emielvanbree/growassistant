# Autoflower Grow Assistant

A simple, privacy-focused, 100% client-side web application to track the lifecycle of your autoflowering plants from seed to harvest.


## ✨ Key Features

  * **🌱 Track Multiple Plants**: Add, name, and manage several plants at once.
  * **🗓️ Visual Growth Timeline**: A color-coded progress bar shows the current growth stage of your plant (Seedling, Vegetative, Flowering, Flush) and estimates the final harvest date.
  * **🔔 Automated Reminders**: The app automatically generates actionable reminders for key events like watering, feeding, starting the flush, and harvesting based on your plant's schedule.
  * **🌿 Strain-Specific Schedules**: Comes pre-loaded with over 20 popular autoflower strains, each with a recommended schedule that you can customize. A generic schedule is also available.
  * **📸 Photo & Note Logging**: Keep a visual diary by uploading photos for each week of growth and add detailed notes in a dedicated section.
  * **🔒 100% Private & Offline**: All your data—including plant names, dates, notes, and photos—is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. No data is ever sent to any server.
  * **🎨 User-Friendly Interface**:
      * **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes for late-night check-ins.
      * **Multi-Language**: Supports English, Dutch, German, French, and Spanish.
